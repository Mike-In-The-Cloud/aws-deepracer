# AWS DeepRacer

**[Full report](https://github.com/Mike-In-The-Cloud/aws-deepracer/blob/main/AWS%20Deepracer%20Report.pdf)** (this is a large file).

This repository contains an investigation into self driving vehicles trained using Reinforcement Learning. 

The reward function that is provided here was also entered into the Deepracer Global league and placed 46<sup>th</sup> out of over 1000 other competitors. Videos of other reward function can be viewed **[here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLHJnNMDewRNjle-g_ezKWwnh0J785v-8J)** with other reward functions found **[here](https://github.com/Mike-In-The-Cloud/Masters-Source-Code)**

Utilising Amazon Web Services **[DeepRacer](https://aws.amazon.com/deepracer/)** as a platform to conduct experiments, and end-to-end solution from training in a simulated environment to testing on real world hardware has been conducted. 

However, this project did not use AWS Services, but instead used Docker Images of the service to bring this particular cloud service to a local machine. This has been achieved by utilising **[DeepRacer for Cloud](https://aws-deepracer-community.github.io/deepracer-for-cloud/)**.
