# AWS DeepRacer

This repository contains an investigation into self driving vehicles trained using Reinforcement Learning. 

Utilising Amazon Web Services DeepRacer as a platform to conduct experiments, and end-to-end solution from training in a simulated environment to testing on real world hardware has been conducted. 

However, this project did not use AWS Services, but instead used Docker Images of the service to bring this particular cloud service to a local machine. This has been achieved by utilising **[DeepRacer for Cloud](https://aws-deepracer-community.github.io/deepracer-for-cloud/)** 



A **[full report](https://github.com/Mike-In-The-Cloud/aws-deepracer/blob/main/AWS%20Deepracer%20Report.pdf)** (this is a large file) can be found here.
